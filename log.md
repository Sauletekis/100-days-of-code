# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Intro to Basic HTML, Basic CSS in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts:** This is much more fun than I thought it would be. It helped me to understand some parts of HTML and CSS I've messed around with before to fix sites. Now I understand why what I did had a result, and understand things I could have done better.

### Day 2: December 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Applied Visual Design in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification

**Thoughts**: OMFG I just learned how to make literal rainbows with repeating-linear-gradient. I will never be the same. And then I added a big COCK to it. Winning.

### Day 3: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Visual Design in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification. And then spent 90 minutes figuring out how to code a bouncing rainbow cock.

**Thoughts**: I see a trend emerging. It was challenging to make this animation but useful for getting a better handle on how it works.

### Day 4: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Accessibility in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification. I didn't make a new dick today, but I learned that I can improve accessibility to yesterday's dick with --<img src="css-animation-1" alt="a bouncing rainbow penis">

**Thoughts**: All jokes aside, I'd never thought about this much before - how screen readers work, how differently abled people use the internet. I'd like to take a page or two from a website I work on and see if I can incorporate some of what I have learned today.

### Day 5: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed Responsive Web Design Principles in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification. Today has been an exhausting and very long day. My progress was progressing - it was not a zero day, and I maintained this commitment. 

**Thoughts**: You know, I am so damn tired, all I want to do is sleep, and I still did this for 15 minutes at 11:30pm at night after working straight through from 9am. Today is an achievement of motivation, tomorrow can be an achievement for coding.

### Day 6: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Flexbox in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification. Another very long working day. It's 2am where I am. Rules say so long as done before going to bed, still counts!

**Thoughts**: I am jonsing to just spend a couple of hours immersed. Looking forward to the weekend!

### Day 8: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Grid exercises in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification, then started in on the Survey Form project.

**Thoughts**: I still have some big feeling of 'Oh Shit' when I am looking at the 'blank page' and trying to think with two brains about what I want to say and what I want it to look like. Starting is painful and then it gets fun :) That said, my form looks hella ugly right now, I need to do more with it!

### Day 9: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Survey Form project in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts**: Radio buttons are causing me to pull my hair out in frustration. I worked for over an hour, and things still look much the same. This is great - it is showing me where I still don't really have a grasp on things.

### Day 10: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Survey Form project in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts**: Another hour spent on radio buttons. No matter what I do, I can't seem to get label text to align left. To soothe my frustration I picked a better font and smashed in checkboxes like a blizzard so it feels like I accomplished **something**. This is challenging me.

### Day 11: January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Survey Form project in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts**: Fixed the radio buttons. Sorting final test-fail (putting button inside the form). Proceed to break everything. So going to stop for now and fix the button tomorrow and then it's done... I hope...

### Day 13: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Landing Page project in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts**: Well, this has been a rabbit hole, hasn't it? Many ideas, going to build this as if it is real. Took so many actions on the basis of this project (getting my own promo video made). Want the form to actually capture an email address.

### Day 14: January 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Landing Page project in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts**: Found some clever solutions. Learned about Font Awesome. Fixed nav bar issue. Sometimes, you spend an hour trying to fix something, and then there is an obvious solution that takes 2 seconds. Sigh. Also imported font isn't working.
