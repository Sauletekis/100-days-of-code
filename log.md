# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Intro to Basic HTML, Basic CSS in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts:** This is much more fun than I thought it would be. It helped me to understand some parts of HTML and CSS I've messed around with before to fix sites. Now I understand why what I did had a result, and understand things I could have done better.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
