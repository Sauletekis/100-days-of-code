# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Intro to Basic HTML, Basic CSS in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts:** This is much more fun than I thought it would be. It helped me to understand some parts of HTML and CSS I've messed around with before to fix sites. Now I understand why what I did had a result, and understand things I could have done better.

### Day 2: December 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Applied Visual Design in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification

**Thoughts**: OMFG I just learned how to make literal rainbows with repeating-linear-gradient. I will never be the same. And then I added a big COCK to it. Winning.

### Day 3: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Visual Design in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification. And then spent 90 minutes figuring out how to code a bouncing rainbow cock.

**Thoughts**: I see a trend emerging. It was challenging to make this animation but useful for getting a better handle on how it works.

### Day 4: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Accessibility in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification. I didn't make a new dick today, but I learned that I can improve accessibility to yesterday's dick with --<img src="css-animation-1" alt="a bouncing rainbow penis">

**Thoughts**: All jokes aside, I'd never thought about this much before - how screen readers work, how differently abled people use the internet. I'd like to take a page or two from a website I work on and see if I can incorporate some of what I have learned today.

### Day 5: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed Responsive Web Design Principles in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification. Today has been an exhausting and very long day. My progress was progressing - it was not a zero day, and I maintained this commitment. 

**Thoughts**: You know, I am so damn tired, all I want to do is sleep, and I still did this for 15 minutes at 11:30pm at night after working straight through from 9am. Today is an achievement of motivation, tomorrow can be an achievement for coding.
