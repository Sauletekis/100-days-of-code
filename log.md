# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Intro to Basic HTML, Basic CSS in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts:** This is much more fun than I thought it would be. It helped me to understand some parts of HTML and CSS I've messed around with before to fix sites. Now I understand why what I did had a result, and understand things I could have done better.

### Day 2: December 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started Applied Visual Design in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification

**Thoughts**: OMFG I just learned how to make literal rainbows with repeating-linear-gradient. I will never be the same. And then I added a big COCK to it. Winning.

### Day 3: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Visual Design in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification. And then spent 90 minutes figuring out how to code a bouncing rainbow cock.

**Thoughts**: I see a trend emerging. It was challenging to make this animation but useful for getting a better handle on how it works.

### Day 4: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Accessibility in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification. I didn't make a new dick today, but I learned that I can improve accessibility to yesterday's dick with --<img src="css-animation-1" alt="a bouncing rainbow penis">

**Thoughts**: All jokes aside, I'd never thought about this much before - how screen readers work, how differently abled people use the internet. I'd like to take a page or two from a website I work on and see if I can incorporate some of what I have learned today.

### Day 5: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed Responsive Web Design Principles in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification. Today has been an exhausting and very long day. My progress was progressing - it was not a zero day, and I maintained this commitment. 

**Thoughts**: You know, I am so damn tired, all I want to do is sleep, and I still did this for 15 minutes at 11:30pm at night after working straight through from 9am. Today is an achievement of motivation, tomorrow can be an achievement for coding.

### Day 6: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Flexbox in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification. Another very long working day. It's 2am where I am. Rules say so long as done before going to bed, still counts!

**Thoughts**: I am jonsing to just spend a couple of hours immersed. Looking forward to the weekend!

### Day 8: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Grid exercises in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification, then started in on the Survey Form project.

**Thoughts**: I still have some big feeling of 'Oh Shit' when I am looking at the 'blank page' and trying to think with two brains about what I want to say and what I want it to look like. Starting is painful and then it gets fun :) That said, my form looks hella ugly right now, I need to do more with it!

### Day 9: January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Survey Form project in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts**: Radio buttons are causing me to pull my hair out in frustration. I worked for over an hour, and things still look much the same. This is great - it is showing me where I still don't really have a grasp on things.

### Day 10: January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Survey Form project in freecodecamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

**Thoughts**: Another hour spent on radio buttons. No matter what I do, I can't seem to get label text to align left. To soothe my frustration I picked a better font and smashed in checkboxes like a blizzard so it feels like I accomplished **something**. This is challenging me.
